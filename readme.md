# ⛲ Solidity Contract Factory - Automating Tech

This repository contains a **Solidity-based Contract Factory** designed for secure,automated contract Deployment. Built for real-world usability, this contract enables users to claim tokens at fixed intervals, supports advanced configurations, and integrates smoothly with Web3 DApps and EVM-compatible chains.

---

## 🔧 Development & Testing

The contract is compatible with:

- Local EVM environments
- **Hardhat** for modern testing, deployment, and scripting workflows
- **Remix IDE** for quick prototyping and debugging

---

## 🚀 Key Features

✅ Fully compliant with **IERC20** standard  
⏳ **Contract Factory** Implementation  
⚙️ Multiple contracts deployment**options per user/wallet**  
🔐 Security checks for re-entrancy and abuse prevention  
🧠 Gas-optimized logic and minimal external dependencies  
👑 Ownable for administrative control(Can be added)
🗓️ Adjustable **claim frequency and token amount**  
🌐 EVM-compatible deployment (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.)

---

## 📦 Installation & Usage

### ⚙️ Deployment

```bash
# Make sure your deployer wallet has ETH/native gas token
# Then compile and deploy using Hardhat or Remix
Compile IERC20Factory.sol

Deploy to your target EVM chain

Configure Contract deployment(Params)

Fund the faucet with the ERC20 tokens

Users can begin claiming tokens at intervals

📌 Supported Chains
Ethereum (Mainnet, Sepolia, etc.)

Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

Polygon (Matic)

Avalanche

Any EVM-compatible chain

🌐 Web3 Integration
This contract can be integrated into any Web3 DApp UI to:

Display contract Deployed status

Trigger contract deployed transactions

Monitor the number of claims made

Handle wallet connections and user feedback

💡 Future Enhancements
🔁 Integrate with Web3 for DEX token swaps

🎁 NFT-based contracts support
